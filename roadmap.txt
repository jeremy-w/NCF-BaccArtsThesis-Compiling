     - This is meant to be a rather brief section. Show what the functional is up against. Really more background, but the standard background, here.
    Definition
        History (quick! use Prog Lang Pragmatics book) -> 1 long day, 2-3 more reasonable days
            Goto-based
            Structured
            OOP
            (AOP)
            Scripting Languages
        Examples -> together with Concepts, 1 day
        Concepts - write before examples/with examples, so we can illustrate concepts with examples
        Problems -> 1 day if you include the thinking, maybe
    Optimization -> 1-3 days
        Draw from Engineering a Compiler. Standard targets of optimization, standard analytic frameworks, scopes of analysis and optimization, difficulties.
    Conclusion, Biblio Refs
Functional => ~4 weeks total; say 11 March 2008 done
    Theory -> 1 day
         - Use Hudak + Type Theory and FP guy for LC; leave Barendregt on the shelf...
        LC
        Typed LC
        Type Theory - just a brief ``it exists, it matters, go elsewhere for details''
    Definition -> 1 long day, 2 regular at most
        - Relate to SSA as FP?
        History - draw from Hudak's Comp. Surv. article
        Examples - use Haskell, since that's what I know
        Concepts - should this be integrated with the history?
        Problems - the ``trivial update'' problem, I/O, acceptance and widespread use; problems also for compilation and optimization
    Case Studies -> Give 1 week on top of understanding to turn my notes into something coherent for my thesis
        OCAML -> Give 1 week to learn OCAML well enough to understand its compiler, 2 at most
        GHC -> Give 1 week to understand GHC
    Conclusion, Biblio Refs
Conclusion -> with Intro, 1 week at most; done during week of Spring Break
    Any Necessary Refs
Introduction

Massive Editing -> 1-2 weeks, done at the beginning of Mod 2 alongside studying for Bacc
Immediately distribute to committee.
Then, Bacc...
