\section{Front End: Analyzing Source Code}
The front end of the compiler is responsible for analyzing the source code. It takes a long string of characters (the program), discerns what each string is meant to be in terms of the ``types of speech'' of the programming language, figures out how the various parts fit together to form a valid program (or that they do not form a valid program, if the programmer has made an error!), and tries to infer the meaning of the parts. The first two steps are similar to the spell-checking and grammar-checking performed by a wordprocessor. The last step is one wordprocessors have not quite achieved just yet. An analogy along the same lines as the others, however, would be ``sense-checking'' or ``sanity-checking,'' which would answer the question, ``This is a syntactically valid sentence, yes, but does it mean anything, or is it nonsense?'' As a whole, the front end of a compiler represents one of the great achievements of computer science: we have powerful formalisms that can be used to specify and automatically generate it.
