\myChapter{Overview}\label{functional:overview}
We have discussed imperative languages at some length. Now, we move on to functional languages.

\begin{description}
\item[\nameref{functional:theory}] discusses some theory basic to functional programming.
\item[\nameref{functional:history}] sketches the history of the functional language family by way of several of its defining languages.
\item[\href{\#casestudies}{Case Studies}] We next turn to the question of how programs in modern functional languages are compiled to run on modern computers. We will answer this by studying two widely-used compilers:
\begin{itemize}
\item \nameref{functional:ghc} examines the architecture of the principal compiler for the Haskell language.
\item \nameref{functional:ocaml} looks at the compiler provided by the developers of the Objective Caml language.
\end{itemize}
