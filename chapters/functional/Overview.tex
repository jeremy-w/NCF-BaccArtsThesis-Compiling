\myChapter{Overview}\label{functional:overview}
We have discussed imperative languages at some length. Now, we move on to functional languages.

\begin{description}
\item[\nameref{functional:theory}] discusses some theory basic to functional programming.
\item[\nameref{functional:history}] sketches the history of the functional language family by way of several of its defining languages.
\item[\nameref{functional:compiling}] describes in broad terms how functional languages are compiled. %and introduces the concept of an abstract machine.
\item[\nameref{casestudy}] addresses the question of how programs in modern functional languages are actually compiled to run on modern computers. We answer this by studying the Glasgow Haskell compiler, the principal compiler for the Haskell language.
