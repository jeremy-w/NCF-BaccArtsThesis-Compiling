\myChapter{Overview}\label{imperative:overview}
The family of imperative programming languages is large. It represents the most commonly employed programming paradigm, and it is in light of it and its accomplishments that all other language families are judged. Before we begin to discuss functional languages, it behooves us to examine their less exotic imperative cousins.
\begin{description}
\item[\nameref{imperative:defining}] looks at what we mean by ``imperative language,'' discusses how imperative languages have developed over time, highlights central concepts of imperative programming, and mentions several problems inherent in the paradigm.% Examples are employed throughout.
\item[\nameref{imperative:compiling}] discusses issues particular to compiling imperative languages.
\item[\nameref{imperative:optimizing}] describes how optimization is performed and introduces basic analyses and optimizations used with imperative programs.%
%TODO: Also need to talk about how we're using imperative in 5m different ways -- imperative program ~ program written in imperative language/style
