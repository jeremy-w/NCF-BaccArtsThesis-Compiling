% thesis.tex
% driver file for LaTeXing the thesis; relies on 
%     header.tex - sets document class, loads packages, configures stuff
%     body.tex - includes the actual text of the document
% header.tex inputs macros.tex, which contains generally useful 
% newcommands
\input{header}
\input{body}

% Note:
%    * You must not use "u etc. in strings/commands that will be spaced out (use \"u or real umlauts instead)
%    * Chapters must be marked with the \myChapter{Foo} command (sorry for the inconvenience at this point)
%    * New enumeration (small caps): \begin{aenumerate} \end{aenumerate}
%    * For margin notes: \graffito{}
%    * Do not use bold fonts in this style, it is designed around them
%    * Use tables as in the examples
%    * There is a problem with the case of math text in part-, 
%      chapter-, and section titles and I have got no clue on how to fix this 
%      (either the case or the spacing breaks). So far, I chose the case. :-(
%    * See loadpackages.sty for useful commands
