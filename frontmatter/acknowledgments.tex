\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis is the capstone of four years of education. I would like to thank the various people and organizations that helped make this education possible: my parents for their constant support; AT\&T (and before them, the SBC Foundation), the CWA Joe Beirne Foundation, First Data Corporation, the German--American Club of Sun City Center, and the New College Foundation for their financial support; and Saint~Louis Priory School of Creve~C\oe ur, Missouri for providing me with a solid grounding in the liberal arts.

I would also like to thank my baccalaureate committee, Drs.~David Mullins, Patrick McDonald, and Karsten Henckell, for their participation in my baccalaureate examination, for the time they spent reading this work, for their comments, for the many wonderful classes they taught in which I had the chance to take part, and for their advice.

The advice of Dr.~Karsten Henckell in particular proved invaluable while I was writing this thesis. Without his counseling on the direction and shape of my thesis, as well as his careful reading and comments, I would never have finished writing this thesis. Katelyn Weissinger and Marvin Sherman read drafts of parts of this work, and their comments and corrections did much to improve it. Any faults that remain are mine alone.
