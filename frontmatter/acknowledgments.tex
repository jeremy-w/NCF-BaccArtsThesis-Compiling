\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis is the capstone of four years of education. I would like to thank the various organizations that helped make this education possible: AT\&T (and before them, the SBC Foundation), First Data Corporation, the German-American Club of Sun City Center, the New College Foundation, and my parents for financial support; St.~Louis Priory School of Creve C\oe ur, Missouri for providing me with a solid grounding in the liberal arts.

As my thesis advisor, Dr.~Karsten Henckell provided invaluable counseling on the direction and shape of my thesis, as well as reading and commenting on the entire opus. Katelyn Weissinger and Marvin Sherman read drafts of this work, and their comments and corrections did much to improve it. Any faults that remain are mine alone.
